### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional by creating proper tests based on the developed user stories. In the end, the program has to function correctly, and as expected for the users, so testing must match the expectations that the users will have. Secure coding must be a priority from the beginning of designing the program. Making sure that proper authentication and authorization parameters are put in place is crucial for building a foundation of secure coding to build upon as that program grows.


### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs should be incorporated into the user stories created during the software development lifecycle. Then any code is built off of these user needs.


### How do I approach designing software?
I like to use an incremental and iterative approach to designing software. I also write a bit of pseudocode before each project to help me understand how I want everything to work together. In this class, I've learned that I like to write all my programs first, then create the test cases based on the user's needs. This checks my program for completeness rather than writing the program for the test cases.
